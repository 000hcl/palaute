### Accessibility document for the course feedback system of the University of Helsinki

This accessibility document is about the accessibility of [coursefeedback.helsinki.fi](coursefeedback.helsinki.fi) and was created on 11.10.2021. The accessibility analysis of the software was done by the developers.

#### Accessibility status

The accessibility of the software as of this day (11.10.2021) is good. The results provided by the tools used were promising and those few minor issues that came up were fixed as a result. The tools didn't bring up any larger issues in accessibility. This might be a direct result from using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as our UI library. Using Material UI helps us take accessibility into account from the ground up.

#### Accessibility tools used

We used two tools to analyse the accessibility of the software:

- [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

#### Feedback

If you notice any accessibility issues while using the software please give us feedback by either contacting the support email at [coursefeedback@helsinki.fi](mailto:coursefeedback@helsinki.fi) or by [creating an issue through github](https://github.com/UniversityOfHelsinkiCS/palaute/issues/new). We are glad to recieve information on how to improve the accessibility for Norppa.
